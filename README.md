### About
Hi, I'm Al Ardosa, I'm here to help you and do advanced studying methods.

I've been working as a senior software developer and tech lead in Lazada and other tech companies for many years and am now taking all that I've learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities of being a developer.

I've coached both kids and adults on how to program.

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for learning and teaching new technologies. I went on to complete a degree in BS Computer Science at System Technology Institute and worked in various developer roles at multinational corporations and startups.

If I can help coders to increase their earning power, so they can better support their communities even better. My specialties are PHP, Laravel, Python, Django, JavaScript, VueJS, ReactJS, HTML5, and CSS3, but because I'm full-stack, I can work my way around most programming languages and frameworks. I live-in Malate-Manila, and Cavite Philippines with my wife and partner, Catherine.

I do all the backend (server), frontend (HTML/JS/CSS), and operations/deployment work. Some of the technologies I've used are Python, Django, PHP, Laravel, Bootstrap, jQuery (Javascript), VueJS, ReactJS. For storage/databases, I've used MySQL, Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, and more.

Having been a self-taught programmer, I understand that there is an overwhelming number of courses and tutorials. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a difficult subject matter, I understand that most people don't have $4,000 to spend on a coding Bootcamp.

Dedicating 100% of my time teaching software development skills in order to work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.

Education should be open to all. And we should not waste a student's valuable time.

I always believed that the final step to learning is teaching. And so I started a software development blog called [alardosa.com.](https://www.alardosa.com/) My goal is to help individuals, developers and tech companies make a better living through their code and technologies.

I love to make ideas easy to understand and fun to learn.

I helped new employees to program, as well as other professionals to automate their work with DevOps, Python, Django, React, PHP, Laravel, VueJS and more..

I can help the no experience in programming to get your first job within 6 months of starting.

If you get stuck with anything, send me a message, I'm here to help.

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn for more information
